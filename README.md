Export all your password stored in safari

I was searching a way to export all my pasword stored by safari to use them in another password manager.
This script (Applescript) work on MacOS Mojave 10.14.1.
It's a modified verion of the script provided by 1Password (https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/30286/mrcs-convert-to-1password-utility/p1) taht does'nt work anymore on MacOS Mojave.

## How to use
- Open the script with Script Editor
- Launch Safari
- Open Safari's preferences and navigate to the Passwords tab
- Unlock the dialog so your list of credentials is visible
- Switch back to Script Editor and hit its Run button
- Switch back to Safari and select one row of the password table
